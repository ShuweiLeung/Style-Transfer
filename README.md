# Neural Style Transfer
## Dataset
We download several images as content and style back plate. All these images are used in **[Gaty' paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf)** so that we can implement the style transfer effect as more as possible.
More style images can be download from WikiArt(https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh)

## Result
All corresponding results is saved in 'styleTransfer/images/result'
Each result image is named by its style and content followed by its corresponding iteration times.

## Demo
Please visit the demo website to see more results!
